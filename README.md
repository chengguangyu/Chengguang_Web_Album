# Chengguang_Web_Album
Build a SPA Web Album using Spring boot and Angular 2

The server side code is written in Java Spring boot in folder "webalbum2".
The front-end code is written in TypeScript Angular 2 in folder "my-album".

Since I used a local MySQL database
if you want to run my code. Please modify the configuration in application properties file to add 
a new MySQL DB.

I will update a remote MySQL later.
